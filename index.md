## About Me 

Welcome to my website! I recently started as a Carnegie Postdoctoral Fellow at the Earth and Planets Laboratory, Carnegie Institution for Science. During my PhD, I worked with Prof. David Bercovici at the Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences, Yale University.

I am generally interested in planetary formation and evolution processes. Particularly, I aim to understand how lanet formation processes affected the evolution of planetary bodies toward their current states. My general research approach is to develop theoretical models and combine the model results with a variety of observations to propose, test, and constrain scenarios of planet formation and evolution.
