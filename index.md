## About Me 

I am a Carnegie Postdoctoral Fellow at the Earth and Planets Laboratory, Carnegie Institution for Science. During my PhD, I worked with Prof. David Bercovici at Yale University.

My research approach is to develop theoretical models and combine the model results with a variety of observations to propose, test, and constrain scenarios of planet formation and evolution. My general research goal is to understand how planets were formed and how planet formation processes affected the evolution of planetary bodies toward their current states.
