## About Me 

Welcome to my website! In September 2023, I will start as a Carnegie Postdoctoral Fellow at the Earth and Planets Laboratory, Carnegie Institution for Science. During my PhD, I worked with Prof. David Bercovici at the Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences, Yale University.

I am generally interested in planetary formation and evolution processes. Particularly, I aim to understand how lanet formation processes affected the evolution of planetary bodies toward their current states. My general research approach is to develop theoretical models and combine the model results with a variety of observations to propose, test, and constrain scenarios of planet formation and evolution.  

Most of my past and ongoing research projects are about planetesimals (asteroid-sized planet build blocks) and planetary embryos (Moon-to-Mars-sized "proto-planets"). Specifically, my research interest covers the following topics:

* Ice sublimation and hydrothermal processes in initially water/ice-rich planetesimals

* The formation and evolution of planetesimal cores and mantle-stripped metallic bodies, and dynamo activities in these objects

* Silicate melt migration and differentiation in planetesimals and planetary embryos

* Volatile depletion in terrestrial bodies due to nebular and planetesimal processes
